    <h1>Bio</h1>
    <p>Paige Ambord is a sociologist whose work centers on how residents identify environmental, health, and safety risks in the built environment. Her recent work considers how residents understand the future risks posed by natural disasters and draws from interviews with landslide survivors in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Helene. Her prior work considers how hazard communications and behavioral interventions can overcome the barriers to recognizing and addressing home health (e.g., lead, radon, indoor air pollution) at both the micro and macro levels of analysis. In her research, she draws upon a variety of methodologies (ethnography, interviews, experiments, surveys) and centers interdisciplinary and community-engaged perspectives. As an instructor, Ambord develops lessons that focus on applying research skills and sociological concepts to real-world environments and problems.</p>
